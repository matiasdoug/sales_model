# Sales Data Modeling

This project provides a basic data modeling solution for sales management. It includes an SQL file containing the database schema and a visual representation of the data model.

## Data Model
This model was created using DbSchema data modeling tools.

The sales data model represents some key entities and relationships involved in managing sales processes. It includes tables for customers, products, orders, seller and inventory. The relationships between these entities are captured through primary and foreign key constraints.

## Database Schema

The SQL file `modeling_sales.sql` contains the database schema definition for implementing the sales data model. It provides the necessary SQL statements to create tables, define relationships, and set up any required indexes or constraints.

To set up the database using the schema, follow these steps:

1. Download the `modeling_sales.sql` file.
2. Open a SQL client Postgresql.
3. Create a new database.
4. Execute the SQL statements from the `modeling_sales.sql` file in the order specified.
5. The database schema will be created along with the necessary tables, columns, and relationships.

Note: Make sure you have the appropriate Postgresql database server and client installed.

## Usage

Once the database schema is set up, you can start populating the tables with data and leveraging the sales data model for your sales management needs. You can use SQL queries to perform operations such as inserting new customer records, managing product inventory, creating orders, and generating sales reports.
